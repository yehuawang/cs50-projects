1. According to Spotify, each aura color represents:
    Purple: passionate
    Green: calm
    Pink: hopeless romatics
    Orange: rebellious, high-energy
    Yellow: focus, motivation, self-improvement
    Blue: wistful, slower tempo

    One way I will propose to calculate the aura colors as follows (based on my own opinion and understanding):

        if AVG(energy > 0.5) AND AVG(valence > 0.5) AND AVG(danceability < 0.5):
                Yellow
        if AVG(energy > 0.5) AND AVG(valence < 0.5) AND AVG(danceability > 0.5):
                Orange
        if AVG(energy > 0.5) AND AVG(valence > 0.5) AND AVG(danceability > 0.5):
                Purple
        if AVG(energy < 0.5) AND AVG(valence > 0.5) AND AVG(danceability < 0.5):
                Green
        if AVG(energy < 0.5) AND AVG(valence > 0.5) AND AVG(danceability < 0.5):
                Pink
        if AVG(energy < 0.5) AND AVG(valence < 0.5) AND AVG(danceability < 0.5):
                Blue

        The AVG(energy) is 0.65906,
        The AVG(valence) is 0.484443,
        The AVG(danceability) is 0.71646

        so according to my categorization, the audio aura will be ORANGE.

2. What I calculated may not represents what the user's aura is, because by some value, say the valence, is very close to middle point of 0.5, and this seems to not be very negative, therefore the categorization of ORANGE may be worng.
    A better way could be to also give aura representation on middle point value, where each color has a "strength", and is based on a non-linear function of the 3 key values (energy, valence, danceability).
    After calculating the "strength" of each color on their non-linear functions, we could select the color with the highest "strength" to be the audio aura of the user.
